    "Kauri trees are a native New Zealand tree that grows in the Upper North Island. Kauri trees can live for over 1000 years, in this time reaching over 50m in height. Their size and strength meant that kauri was popular for early European settlers in boat making. Kauri gum was used in paint, lino and varinishes. The uses of kauri mean that kauri forests were extensively harvested serverly reducing the number of karui trees that remain today. Kauri trees play an important role in the ecosystem of the northern ranges where they exist due to thier influence on soil properties, nurtrient cycling and plant community composition [(Wyse, 2013)](https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/handle/2292/21399). Today kauri dieback disease threatens these key species. Kauri dieback disease is a pathogen called *Phytophthora agathidicida* that exists in soil. It kills kauri trees by damaging the tissue in the roots of kauri preventing nurtients to be uptaken by the tree. The time between a tree getting infected and showing symptoms varies between trees so tracking tree health is an important method in assessing kauri dieback disease. For more information on kauri dieback disease see [Keep Kauri Standing](https://www.kauridieback.co.nz/). \n",
